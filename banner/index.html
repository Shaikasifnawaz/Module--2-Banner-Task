        <h3>Food Driver</h3>
        <p>Swiggy was one of India’s biggest startup success stories of 2018. From entering the prestigious club of unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion) to becoming India’s most valued foodtech venture, the Bengaluru-based food delivery startup
            had many highs this year. Most recently, on Dec.20, it raised $1 billion (around Rs7,000 crore) in the largest-ever funding round by an Indian food tech startup. This round reportedly values the four-year-old startup at $3.3 billion, according
            to analysts.Now, Swiggy, which joined the food-tech race in India later than some of its rivals, is the fifth most valued startup in India, analysts said. It has left behind some of its older rivals like Zomato, which was founded in 2008 but
            was valued at $1.1 billion in February. But Swiggy’s success has come after several speed bumps. The first one was even before its inception. In August 2013, a few years after graduating from BITS Pilani Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy founded
            Bundl Technologies, a logistics and shipping startup for small sellers retailing on e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart and Amazon India. The venture failed to take off and within a year, the two shelved their original business model to
            start Swiggy.</p>

        <h3>Taste The Market</h3>
        <p>When Swiggy started out in 2014, it was seen as a late entrant to an overcrowded market. The online food ordering and delivery market was not considered attractive back then, and Zomato, the leader in food-tech, had decided not to expand its delivery
            business, which was seemingly messy and unviable. Yet, in less than four years, Swiggy is part of the much-vaunted league of ‘unicorn’ startups. It has also forced an about-turn from Zomato, which is now investing hundreds of crores of rupees
            to catch up with Swiggy, which sits pretty at the top of the online food ordering business.Swiggy is literally the only consumer internet startup from the 2014-2015 hyper-funding wave that continues to thrive. That wave was supposed to produce
            dozens of successful companies and a handful of unicorns. Once the dust settled, only Swiggy succeeded. Along the way, it has beaten both far older companies, such as Zomato and Foodpanda, as well as peers, including Tinyowl, which eventually
            collapsed.
